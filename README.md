# Water Quality Forecasting Repository

Welcome to the water quality forecasting repository! This repository contains all the necessary components to understand and replicate the multivariate time series forecasting for water quality parameters. We make use of advanced machine learning models like Random Forest and LSTM to achieve accurate predictions.

## Repository Structure:
- `train_data.csv`: Training dataset to build and validate the forecasting models.
- `test_data.csv`: Test dataset to evaluate the model's forecasting capabilities.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains all the necessary packages and their versions required to replicate the analysis.
- `data_model.ipynb`: A comprehensive Jupyter notebook detailing every step of the process - from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to feature engineering and model building.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary packages using the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open to walk through the entire process.

## Models Used:
- **Random Forest**: A versatile ensemble method, perfect for handling multivariate data structures.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series forecasting.

## Feedback and Questions:
If you have any questions, suggestions, or run into any issues, please feel free to get in touch.
